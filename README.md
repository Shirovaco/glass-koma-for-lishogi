# Glass Koma for Lishogi

This is an experimental transparent shogi piece set designed for lishogi.

## Concept

Traditional shogi pieces are solid objects that cover the board.
This design treats pieces as transparent information layers, allowing the board to remain visible.

## Motivation

I created this piece set to explore the possibility of user-generated shogi skins and visual customization in shogi platforms.

## Status

Prototype / experimental
